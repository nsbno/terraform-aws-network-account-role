A module to allow the networking account to tag subnets

toc::[]

== About

Because AWS Resource Access Manager doesn't share tags together with the resources, we need to do it ourselves.

This module allows a networking account to tag resources that it has shared.

== Usage

Place the module in all environments within your `<account>-aws` repository!

[source, hcl]
----
module "networking_cross_accountf-role" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-network-account-role?ref=x.y.z"

  # TODO: Replace with your networking account's ID.
  account_id = 1234567890
}
----

This will create a role that allows your networking account to only tag subnets.
